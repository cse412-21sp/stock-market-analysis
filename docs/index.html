To invest is to put money with the expectation of revenue in the future.
In general, investors would gain their revenue if the companies kept a good performance.
However, investment is way more complex than just a plain statement. There are so many different theories and factors that are directly affecting the stock market in general.
Especially, the process of globalization has accelerated and expanded to almost every country in the world.
Thus, we want to predict the high and low in stock market with a few interesting features and events.
We will focus on the some major stock markets, such as China, Japan, and the US. We also are going to dive deeper into topics like national bound and gold price.
These two factors were commonly used in the past to predict the economy status.
In this website we will look at a few analyses on the stock market,</p><h2 id="in-a-grand-scale,-what-is-stock-market-strongly-tight-with?">In a grand scale, what is stock market strongly tight with?</h2><p>Ever since 2008 economy crisis, the US market has pushed the stock market higher and higher. Until today, it is almost a 13 years bull market.
 (<em>Bull Market</em>: A market that is only on the rise.) Many people assumed that the rise of stock market is inevitably connecting to the overall economy.
This statement is not wrong but neither absolute correct. A good economy does not guarantee a good market. Vice versa, a good market may not represent a
good economy state. To prove my point here I presented two traditional economy standards of financial evaluation. The first chart is about gold storage.
Overall, gold is the most powerful and stable trading goods. The second chart is picturing national debt. The higher the number means a serious trouble in
finance because the country needs to repay its debt in the future.</p><div><iframe scrolling="no" style="border:none" seamless="" src="https://plotly.com/~weixingnie/2/?showlink=false" height="600" width="100%"></iframe></div><div><iframe scrolling="no" style="border:none" seamless="" src="https://plotly.com/~weixingnie/8/?showlink=false" height="600" width="100%"></iframe></div><p>In comparison between the previous two charts and the following visualization, we can see a remarkable shift in the leading markets.
SSE is the main market standard for China. JPN is the market standard data for Japan. SP500 is the standard and Poor’s 500.</p><div><iframe scrolling="no" style="border:none" seamless="" src="https://plotly.com/~weixingnie/10/?showlink=false" height="600" width="100%"></iframe></div><h2 id="how-did-the-covid-pandemic-affect-the-returns-of-the-market?-(cy)">How did the COVID pandemic affect the returns of the market? (CY)</h2><p>Here, we will use VFINX, the S&amp;P 500 index as reference to the whole market. VFINX offers exposure to 500 of the largest U.S companies, which span many different industries and account for about three-fourth of the U.S stock market’s value. The key risk for the fund is the volatility that comes with its full exposure to the stock market.</p><p>First, let’s compare the variation of daily return in a month for the past 5 years in the boxplot below. Select the month you want to compare with the slider below the chart.</p><div><iframe scrolling="no" style="border:none" seamless="" src="https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~yuchun00/1.embed?showlink=false" height="600" width="100%"></iframe></div><p>Very clearly, due the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown since March 2020, in most of the months of 2020 we saw a larger variation in daily returns compared to the prior years. In March we saw the highest variation, with a lowest daily return of -12% and a highest daily return of 9%; much higher than the March in the prior years. While we did not see as big of a variation in the remaining months as we did in March, for most of the months the variation were still bigger than the prior years. It is fair to say that we did see a more volatile year in the U.S. market due to the COVID 19 pandemic.</p><div><iframe scrolling="no" style="border:none" seamless="" src="https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~angusm1/1/#/?showlink=false" height="600" width="100%"></iframe></div><p>One thing that we were interested in is how the stock market varies across industries. To examine this we found six industry specific index funds and tracked their monthly returns
over the past 10 years. For the specific industries we chose natural resources, transportation, consumer essentials, financial services, health care, and technology. We felt that
categories are some of the most influential industries and best represent the stock market.</p><p>From the return distribution we can see that Technology and Financial services have the most normal distribution. These industries drive much of the stock market and are therefore
very reliable. On the other hand we can see that the transportation and natural resource industries have a slight negative skew. This could be due to the drastic decline in demand
for these industries due to the pandemic!</p><p>I will also be creating an equity curve for each industry. The visualization will have animation that tracks the value on a dollar investment over time. The initial investment value will be able to be changed by the user!</p></div></div></div></div>
